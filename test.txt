The primary reason for writing this document is that a lot of 
readers feel the existing HOWTO to be too short and incomplete, 
while the Bash Scripting guide is too much of a reference work. 
There is nothing in between these two extremes. I also wrote 
this guide on the general principal that not enough free basic 
courses are available, though they should be.

This is a practical guide which, while not always being too 
serious, tries to give real-life instead of theoretical
examples. I partly wrote it because I don't get excited with 
stripped down and over-simplified examples written by people 
who know what they are talking about, showing some really cool 
Bash feature so much out of its context that you cannot ever 
use it in practical circumstances. You can read that sort of 
stuff after finishing this book, which contains exercises and 
examples that will help you survive in the real world.
